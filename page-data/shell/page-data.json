This intermidating program, with its blinking green cursor against a  black background was, in the old times, the only real way people interfaced with computers. The history of the CLI is a facinating story and it‚Äôs full of various decisions along the way that have come to make the modern CLI what it is today. </p>\n<p>So what is the shell? A shell is a CLI, as you might have guessed, and it comes with a range of features and utilities that the user can use to do stuff with the computer that might be harder or even impossible to do with a convential GUI style application. The shell can create files and folders, run programs and even connect to other computers. </p>\n<h3>Windows, Linux, Mac and Shells</h3>\n<p>One thing that is useful to know is what kind of shell you have available to you. As mentioned earlier shells come in all kinds of styles. Different shells have been developed alongside different operating systems and you could right a whole book on the differences between them. For brevity however there is two main kinds of shells, Windows based and Unix based which include linux and macOS. These shells just have different commands for the same actions such as creating folders or changing directories but largely enable users to access the same programs. </p>\n<h3>Great, so how do I start?</h3>\n<p>If your running macOS or Linux, you can use terminal app. By default you have access to the bash shell. This is the out the box shell. When you open it up you‚Äôll see your root directory. From here you can practily do what ever you want. If you‚Äôre someone who wants to store files you can download the AWS cli and upload terebytes of data, if you work with images you can use a bash script to automate editing files in batches and if you‚Äôre a developer you can setup servers, download software and deploy apps. Theres alot that can be down here.
